# YMS - Youtube Music Spider
Node JS app for running a youtube's crawler that search and import music videos on mysql database.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Some things you need to install before run the project ✌🏼
```
$ npm install sequelize
$ npm install mysql2
$ npm install -g sequelize-auto
```


## Installing

### Database Setup
Create “*/config*” folder and place there a file called “*config.json*” with this structure:
```
"development": {
    "username": "<db-user>",
    "password": "<db-pasword>",
    "database": "<db-name>",
    "host": "<db-host>",
    "dialect": "mysql",
    "youtube_api_key": "<youtube-api-key>",
    "last_fm_api_key": "YOUR_LASTFM_API_KEY"
  }
```
Insert your database instance informations and generate [YouTube API Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) and [last.fm key](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create).

### Import Migrations
Next create the structure of the DB running the command:
```
$ npm run import:migrations
```

### Models
Now rename file “*auto-generate-models-example.sh*” into “*auto-generate-models.sh*” and edit it with your database instance info: 
```
sequelize-auto -o "./Models/BaseStructure/" -d <db-name> -h <db-host> -u <db-user> -p <port> -x <db-password> -e mysql
```

Final step is about create Models from Database tables schema with running
```
$ sh ./auto-generate-models.sh
```
**NB**: the last step should be repeated every time you want to change your local database schema.


## Test Setup

### Models
Check into “*/models/baseStructure/*” list of created Models (number must match with database tables number).

### Migrations
List of tables that must be in your database instance after the migration (see Installing section)
1. Artists
2. ArtistsAndBands
3. Channels
4. FavoriteVideos
5. Genres
6. Productions
